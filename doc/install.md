## Installation Guide

The easiset way to install xlearn is to use pip:

    pip install xlearn

You can also build xLearn from source code.

For now, the xLearn can support Linux and Mac osx. This page gives instructions on how to build and install the xLearn package from source code. It consists of two steps:

 1. First build the executable files (`xlearn_train` and `xlearn_predict`) and shared library (`libxlearn.so` for Linux and `libxlearn.dylib` for Mac osx) from the C++ codes.
 2. Then install the python package.

### Build executable file and shared libaray

Our goal is to build the shared libary:

 - On Linux the target library is `libxlearn.so`
 - On Mac osx the target library is `libxlearn.dylib`

Also, we will build the executable files, which can be used in commad line. The executable files include:

 - `xlearn_train` is for training task.
 - `xlearn_predict` is for prediction task.

xLearn doesn't rely on any thrid-party library and hence users can just clone the code and compile it by using `cmake`. To compile xLearn we need a c++ compiler supoorting `C++ 11` (e.g., g++4.8 or higher)

#### Install GCC or Clang

If you have already installed your compiler before, you can skip this step.

  * On Cygwin, run `setup.exe` and install `gcc` and `binutils`.
  * On Debian/Ubuntu Linux, type the command `sudo apt-get install gcc binutils` to install GCC, or `sudo apt-get install clang` to install Clang.
  * On FreeBSD, type the command `sudo pkg_add -r clang` to install Clang.  Note that since version 9.0, FreeBSD does not update GCC but relies completely on Clang.
  * On Mac OS X, install XCode gets you Clang.

#### Install CMake

If you have already installed CMake before, you can skip this step.

To install CMake from binary packages:

  * On Cygwin, run `setup.exe` and install `cmake`.
  * On Debian/Ubuntu Linux, type the command `sudo apt-get install cmake`.
  * On FreeBSD, type the command `sudo pkg_add -r cmake`.
  * On Mac OS X, if you have [http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ Howebew], you can use the command `brew install cmake`, or if you have [http://www.macports.org/ MacPorts], run `sudo port install cmake`.  You won't want to have both Homebrew and !MacPorts installed.

You can also download binary or source package of [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html) and install it manually.

#### Build xLearn

Now you can build xLearn. First clone the repositpory:

    git clone https://github.com/aksnzhy/xlearn.git

and then build using the following commands:

    cd xlearn; mkdir build; cd build
    cmake ..
    make

Actually you can just use the xLearn by command line now. You can use the follow scripts to test your building.

    ./xlearn_train ./small_train.txt -v ./small_test.txt -s 2
    ./xlearn_predict ./small_test.txt ./small_train.txt.model

For the useage of xlearn command line, please see this page: [command_line.md][1]

### Python Package Installation

Two ways can be used to install xlearn python package.

#### Using `install-python.sh`

Users can use the install-python.sh script to install python package.

    cd python-package
    ./install-python.sh

The users can make a test: 

    python test_python.py

#### Or set python path manually

In addtion, we can only set the environment variable `PYTHONPATH` to tell python where to find the library. For example assume we cloned `xLearn` on the home directory `~`, then we can added the following line in ~/.bashrc. It is ***recommended for developers*** who may change the code. The changes will be immediately reflected once you pulled the code and rebuild the project.

    export PYTHONPATH=~/xlearn/build/python-package/xlearn
    
Then you need to type source command to reset your profile:

    source ~/.bashrc
